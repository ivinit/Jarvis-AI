Our team worked on adding new features to an existing personal assistant program called "Jarvis-AI". The program uses voice recognition and text-to-speech technology to interact with the user and perform various tasks.

We added the following features to the program:
- Reminder list: the program can store and read reminders from a file.
- Screenshot: the program can take a screenshot of the current screen.
- CPU and battery usage: the program can display the current CPU and battery usage of the system.
- Jokes: the program can tell non-funny jokes.
- Weather: the program can display the weather of the user's current location.
- Google and YouTube search: the program can perform search queries on Google and YouTube.
- YouTube downloader: the program can download videos from YouTube.
- Distance between two cities: the program can calculate the distance between two cities.

In addition, the program can perform several other tasks such as shutting down, logging out, or restarting the system, searching on Wikipedia, telling the current time and date, playing songs from Spotify, and displaying its features.

Our team worked together to write the code for the new features and tested them extensively to ensure they worked as intended. We believe that these new features make the program more useful and enjoyable for users.

Overall, we are proud of our work and hope that users will find the new features helpful.
