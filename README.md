As a team, we collaborated on an existing project and introduced several modifications to enhance its functionality. Among these changes, we utilized packages such as PyJokes, Spotipy, Psutil, and Wikipedia to improve the project's capabilities. With our combined efforts, we were able to deliver a more robust and efficient solution that exceeded the project's initial requirements.
